# ChromeJunkie
ChromeJunkie is a cross-platform forensic framework for Google Chrome.

ChromeJunkie v1 will only work with python 3.x. a Python 2.7 version will be available soon!!
Some features in this Script requires additional Python modules: beautifulsoup4 and win3crypt.
The best way to get win32crypt is to install Pywin32.
Here you can find the latest build on Pywin32: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20221/
Make sure that you download the version that matches both your python interpreter version and you computer architecture!!

Feel free to report issues, this is the first version of the script, let's make it better together!!
